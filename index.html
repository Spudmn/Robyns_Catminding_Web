<!--                     <p class="lead">Robyn has been looking after my furry friends for 11 (or is it 12) years now, and has been 100% reliable and great to deal with. The cats love her, and I always come home to a happy, bright cat. -->
<!-- Heather Bailey -->

<!-- Robyn has provided cat minding services to my cats for more than 15 years. You could not wish to have a kinder, more qualified and reliable cat minder than Robyn. Robyn is always 100% reliable, has a genuine love for cats and leaves detailed notes about how your pets have been while you are away. I would not hesitate to recommend Robyn's cat minding services to any pet owner who wants to relax in the knowledge that their cats are receiving exceptional care in their absence. -->
<!-- Lou Lenape -->

<!-- We have known Robyn for at least 15 years, meeting her when she was working as a Veterinary Nurse at a practice in Mt Eden. We have always used Robyn to take care of our fur-babies when we are away. Her expertise and experience as a vet nurse combined with her love of cats, reliability and integrity means that we know our cats and home are in good hands and that everything is being tended to, without even needing to ask sometimes! A few years ago we had a very unwell cat, and Robyn took extra care with him. Robyn is completely trustworthy, professional, and considerate. The friends we have recommended Robyn to over the years have all been extremely happy with her services also.  -->
<!-- Jennifer Pilkington -->

<!-- Robyn has looked after two of our furry family members for almost a decade. The recommendation from a friend coupled with Robyn’s experience as a vet nurse first inspired us to ask her to look after our cat. We get peace of mind knowing when we are away our cat is well loved and should anything bad happen we have confidence Robyn can identify the issue and take care of it, including being an authorised caregiver at our cat’s vet. Our trust in Robyn means she has a permanent key to our home; this makes life so much easier when we invariably decide to go away at the last minute and call upon her services and don’t have to worry about getting a key to her. Robyn can also provide practical advice, like a natural way to stop the ants from attacking our cat’s food bowl. We would have no hesitation recommending Robyn’s cat minding services. -->
<!-- Max the Cat, Miranda & Cary Young -->

<!-- Robyn has been looking after my cats for years and I can’t rave about her fantastic service enough, she is always going above and beyond the call of duty. I have so many examples of this I wouldn’t know where to begin. She is an absolute gem and I can recommend her and would be happy to talk to anyone who wishes to do so. -->

<!-- Heather Bailey -->

<!-- Thank you so much for yet again looking after my cats. It is good for me to know that they are being looked after someone who both cares about cats but also someone who has experience with their health issues. You are always available and reliable. -->
<!-- J Riley -->

<!-- Robyn has been providing cat minding and nursing services to me for the last 8 years. The professional services that she offers consistently exceed my expectations. When I travel, I am confident that my feline family back home is getting the best attention possible. She is always contactable and keeps me updated by text or email. Robyn is a totally trustworthy, kind, caring and very competent person. She is a devoted cat lover and treats my cats as if they were her own. When my last cat was suffering from kidney failure, Robyn was there at every stage of the journey providing nursing care, knowledge and support. I have no hesitation in recommending Robyn to anyone who requires the very best in cat minding services. -->
<!-- A Stokes -->

<!-- We have been extremely happy with Robyn's expert care of our animals over the past 15 years. We go on holiday knowing our pets are reliably cared for every day, cuddled and loved. She even brings the mail in for us! Robyn follows our fussy pet instructions fully and provides a full report upon our return. The fact that she is a former vet nurse is also very reassuring if pet health issues arise while we're away. We heartily recommend Robyn's Pet Minding =AD her quality of service is second to none. -->
